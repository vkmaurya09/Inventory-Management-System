# Inventory-Management-System
In Inventory management system i have created two section. 
In first section "ADD PRODUCT" we have to import JSON then open record.json file where we have already some item and we have to add some more item we have to write product details like product ID , product name , product price and product quantity. If we want to change the quantity or add new quantity in existing product so we can change by their product ID. For save this record we have open file and use write function.
For deleting any record we have to use "del" function to delete

In second section "PURCHASE PRODUCTS" we have to open file and then provide product ID and quantity and it will calculate automatically product billing amount then we have to save this in sales.json file
